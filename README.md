# Abandon Mint Syntax Theme

Atom Syntax Theme based on my [Abaddon Cream Syntax Theme](https://github.com/Tirjasdyn/AbandonCream-syntax). I spelled Abadon wrong and decided to stick with it.

Abadon Creame is light theme with highlighting in pastels. Punctuation is called out in different colors as well as HTML entities. I use this with the One Light UI theme. This theme is update to date with Atom 1.56 release.

This theme includes AmpScript spefic hightlighting as well..because SFMC and email FTW. Screenshots on GitHub.
